### Notes:
# - Order status will automatically update when trades are executed:
#   - OPEN: Order is active and waiting for matching
#   - PARTIALLY_FILLED: Order has been partially matched
#   - FILLED: Order has been completely matched
#   - CANCELLED: Order has been cancelled by user
# - The system synchronizes blockchain state with cache automatically
# - Order amounts are updated to reflect remaining quantity after partial fills
# - Transaction hashes are recorded for both order placement and completion
# - Order IDs are now tracked in both TransactionCompleted and OrderCancelled events
