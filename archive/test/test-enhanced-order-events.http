### Test Enhanced Order Events

### 1. Test Order Cancellation with Order ID
POST http://localhost:3000/trading/cancel-order
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "orderId": "1",
  "orderType": "buy"
}

### 2. Test Order Placement (to get order IDs for testing)
POST http://localhost:3000/trading/place-order
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "amount": 100,
  "price": 50,
  "orderType": "buy"
}

### 3. Test Sell Order Placement
POST http://localhost:3000/trading/place-order
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "amount": 100,
  "price": 50,
  "orderType": "sell"
}

### 4. Test Order Cancellation for Sell Order
POST http://localhost:3000/trading/cancel-order
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

{
  "orderId": "2",
  "orderType": "sell"
}

### Notes:
# - These tests will validate that order IDs are properly included in OrderCancelled events
# - When orders match, TransactionCompleted events will include both buyOrderId and sellOrderId
# - Check the backend logs to verify order IDs are being logged correctly
# - Transaction logs should now include order ID information
# - Monitor blockchain events to ensure proper order ID transmission
