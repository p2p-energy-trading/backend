# Smart Contract Market Token Supply Functions - Implementation Completed

## Overview
Added new functions to the Market.sol smart contract to retrieve total ETK and IDRS token supply held by the market contract. These functions provide visibility into market liquidity and token distribution.

## Functions Added

### 1. getTotalETKSupplyInMarket()
- **Purpose**: Returns the total ETK tokens held by the market contract
- **Return Type**: `uint256`
- **Access**: Public view function
- **Implementation**: Uses `etk_token.balanceOf(address(this))`

### 2. getTotalIDRSSupplyInMarket()
- **Purpose**: Returns the total IDRS coins held by the market contract
- **Return Type**: `uint256` 
- **Access**: Public view function
- **Implementation**: Uses `idrs_coin.balanceOf(address(this))`

### 3. getMarketLiquidity()
- **Purpose**: Returns comprehensive market liquidity information
- **Return Type**: Tuple containing:
  - `etkSupply`: ETK tokens in market
  - `idrsSupply`: IDRS coins in market
  - `buyOrderCount`: Number of active buy orders
  - `sellOrderCount`: Number of active sell orders
- **Access**: Public view function
- **Benefit**: Single call to get complete market state

## Code Changes

### Market.sol
```solidity
// Get total ETK supply held by the market contract
function getTotalETKSupplyInMarket() public view returns (uint256) {
    return etk_token.balanceOf(address(this));
}

// Get total IDRS supply held by the market contract
function getTotalIDRSSupplyInMarket() public view returns (uint256) {
    return idrs_coin.balanceOf(address(this));
}

// Get market liquidity information including token supplies and order counts
function getMarketLiquidity() public view returns (
    uint256 etkSupply,
    uint256 idrsSupply,
    uint256 buyOrderCount,
    uint256 sellOrderCount
) {
    return (
        etk_token.balanceOf(address(this)),
        idrs_coin.balanceOf(address(this)),
        buyOrderIds.length,
        sellOrderIds.length
    );
}
```

## Test File Created
- **File**: `test-market-supply-functions.http`
- **Tests**: HTTP requests to test the new smart contract functions (when exposed via backend API)
- **Coverage**: All three new functions plus related market data endpoints

## Benefits

### 1. Market Transparency
- Provides visibility into total token supply locked in the market
- Helps users understand market liquidity

### 2. Analytics Support
- Enables analytics dashboards to show market depth
- Supports risk assessment and market analysis

### 3. Efficient Data Retrieval
- Single function call to get complete market state
- Optimized for frontend dashboard integration

### 4. Gas Efficiency
- View functions don't consume gas
- Can be called frequently without cost concerns

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Backend API Integration
If you want to expose these functions via the backend API, you can:

1. **Add to BlockchainService** (src/services/blockchain.service.ts):
```typescript
async getETKSupplyInMarket(): Promise<string> {
  return await this.marketContract.getTotalETKSupplyInMarket();
}

async getIDRSSupplyInMarket(): Promise<string> {
  return await this.marketContract.getTotalIDRSSupplyInMarket();
}

async getMarketLiquidity(): Promise<{
  etkSupply: string;
  idrsSupply: string;
  buyOrderCount: string;
  sellOrderCount: string;
}> {
  const result = await this.marketContract.getMarketLiquidity();
  return {
    etkSupply: result[0].toString(),
    idrsSupply: result[1].toString(),
    buyOrderCount: result[2].toString(),
    sellOrderCount: result[3].toString()
  };
}
```

2. **Add Controller Endpoints**: Create REST endpoints in a controller to expose these functions

## Validation Status
- ✅ Smart contract functions added
- ✅ Test file created
- ✅ Documentation completed
- ⏳ Backend API integration (optional)

## Files Modified/Created
1. `/contracts/src/Market.sol` - Added new supply functions
2. `/test-market-supply-functions.http` - Test file for new functions
3. `/MARKET_SUPPLY_FUNCTIONS_COMPLETION.md` - This documentation

The smart contract now provides comprehensive visibility into market token supply and liquidity, supporting better market analytics and transparency.
