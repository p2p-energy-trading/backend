# Settlement Energy Enhancement - Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the EnerLink P2P Energy Trading backend to include `settlementEnergyWh` property in real-time energy data and settlement estimator endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Service (`src/services/dashboard.service.ts`)
- **Modified `getRealTimeEnergyData` method** to include `settlementEnergyWh` in time series output
- **Single meter case**: Added `settlementEnergyWh: point.settlementEnergy` to the mapping
- **Multiple meters case**: 
  - Updated interfaces to include `settlementEnergy` property
  - Enhanced data transformation to include settlement energy data per subsystem
  - Added proper type safety with fallback values

### 2. Energy Settlement Service (`src/services/energy-settlement.service.ts`)
- **Updated `SettlementEstimatorData` interface** to include optional `settlementEnergyWh` property
- **Enhanced `getSettlementEstimator` method** to extract and return settlement energy data from latest real-time reading
- **Added type safety** for accessing settlement energy data from time series

### 3. Energy Readings Detailed Service (`src/modules/EnergyReadingsDetailed/EnergyReadingsDetailed.service.ts`)
- **Updated `findTimeSeriesForMultipleMeters` method**:
  - Modified SQL query to select `settlement_energy_wh` field
  - Updated data processing to include settlement energy per subsystem
  - Enhanced type definitions to include `settlementEnergy` in return structure
  - Updated internal Map types to support the new data structure

## API Output Enhancement

### Real-time Energy Data Endpoint (`GET /dashboard/realtime-energy/:prosumerId`)
Now includes `settlementEnergyWh` in each time series point:
```json
{
  "lastUpdate": "2024-07-01T10:30:00.000Z",
  "timeSeries": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-07-01T10:30:00.000Z",
      "solar": 1.2758,
      "load": 0.9948,
      "battery": 0.1522,
      "batteryDirection": "charging",
      "gridExport": 0.0386,
      "gridImport": 0.0008,
      "netFlow": 0.0378,
      "meterId": "METER_001",
      "settlementEnergyWh": {
        "solar": 15.23495,
        "load": 10.1163,
        "battery": 1.793849,
        "gridExport": 1.959955,
        "gridImport": 0.004
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Settlement Estimator Endpoint (`GET /energy/settlement-estimator`)
Now includes `settlementEnergyWh` from the latest reading:
```json
{
  "status": "EXPORTING",
  "periodMinutes": 5,
  "currentPowerKw": 1.85,
  "averagePowerKw": 1.73,
  "estimatedEtkAtSettlement": 0.145,
  "currentRunningEtk": 0.087,
  "periodStartTime": "10:25",
  "currentTime": "10:28",
  "periodEndTime": "10:30",
  "progressPercentage": 60.0,
  "timeRemaining": "02:15",
  "netEnergyWh": 173.2,
  "settlementEnergyWh": {
    "solar": 15.23495,
    "load": 10.1163,
    "battery": 1.793849,
    "gridExport": 1.959955,
    "gridImport": 0.004
  }
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **IoT Device** → Sends energy data with `settlement_energy_wh` per subsystem
2. **EnergyReadingsDetailedService** → Stores and retrieves settlement energy data
3. **DashboardService** → Includes settlement energy in real-time data aggregation
4. **EnergySettlementService** → Uses settlement energy for estimator calculations
5. **API Endpoints** → Return enhanced data with settlement energy information

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Settlement Tracking**: Frontend can now track settlement energy accumulation in real-time
2. **Enhanced Estimator**: Settlement estimator includes actual accumulated energy per subsystem
3. **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth for settlement energy across all endpoints
4. **Performance Optimized**: Leverages existing optimized query infrastructure
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- New `settlementEnergyWh` property is optional in settlement estimator
- No breaking changes to existing data structures

## Testing
Created test file: `test-settlement-estimator-with-settlement-energy.http`
- Tests real-time energy data endpoint
- Tests settlement estimator endpoint  
- Verifies `settlementEnergyWh` property inclusion

## Files Modified
1. `/src/services/dashboard.service.ts`
2. `/src/services/energy-settlement.service.ts`  
3. `/src/modules/EnergyReadingsDetailed/EnergyReadingsDetailed.service.ts`
4. `/test-settlement-estimator-with-settlement-energy.http` (new)

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All changes implemented and tested for TypeScript compliance.

The enhancement successfully provides comprehensive settlement energy data in both real-time monitoring and settlement estimation, enabling accurate tracking of energy accumulation per subsystem for settlement purposes.
