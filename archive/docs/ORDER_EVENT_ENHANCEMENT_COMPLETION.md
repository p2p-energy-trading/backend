# Order Event Enhancement Implementation

## Summary

Successfully updated both the Market.sol smart contract and the blockchain service to include order IDs in the `OrderCancelled` event and ensure the `TransactionCompleted` event properly handles order IDs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Market.sol Contract Updates

**OrderCancelled Event Enhancement:**
- Updated `OrderCancelled` event signature to include `orderId` parameter
- Updated both emit statements in `cancelOrder()` function to include the order ID

**Before:**
```solidity
event OrderCancelled(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 price,
    bool isBuy,
    uint256 timestamp
);
```

**After:**
```solidity
event OrderCancelled(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 price,
    bool isBuy,
    uint256 timestamp,
    uint256 orderId
);
```

### 2. Blockchain Service Updates

**Event ABI Updates:**
- Updated `TransactionCompleted` event ABI to include `buyOrderId` and `sellOrderId`
- Updated `OrderCancelled` event ABI to include `orderId`

**Event Handler Updates:**
- Enhanced `handleTransactionCompleted()` to accept and process `buyOrderId` and `sellOrderId`
- Enhanced `handleOrderCancelled()` to accept and process `orderId`
- Updated transaction logging to include order IDs for better tracking
- Improved logging messages to include order ID information

**Event Listener Updates:**
- Updated event listener signatures to match the new event parameters
- Ensured proper parameter passing to event handlers

## Benefits

1. **Better Order Tracking:** Both events now include order IDs for precise order identification
2. **Enhanced Transaction Logging:** Order IDs are now logged in transaction records
3. **Improved Cache Management:** Order cancellations can now target specific orders in cache
4. **Better Debugging:** Logs now include order IDs for easier troubleshooting
5. **Data Consistency:** Blockchain events and backend data structures are now fully synchronized

## Implementation Status

✅ **Market.sol Contract:** OrderCancelled event updated with orderId
✅ **Market.sol Contract:** Both emit statements updated to include orderId  
✅ **Blockchain Service:** Event ABI definitions updated
✅ **Blockchain Service:** Event handlers updated with new parameters
✅ **Blockchain Service:** Event listeners updated with new signatures
✅ **Transaction Logging:** Enhanced to include order IDs
✅ **Build Verification:** Project compiles without errors

## Testing

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while enhancing event data. All existing functionality continues to work, with added order ID tracking capabilities.

## Files Modified

1. `/contracts/src/Market.sol`
   - OrderCancelled event definition
   - cancelOrder() function emit statements

2. `/src/services/blockchain.service.ts`
   - marketABI event definitions
   - handleTransactionCompleted() function
   - handleOrderCancelled() function  
   - Event listener configurations

## Next Steps

The enhanced events are now ready for testing with:
- Order cancellation operations
- Trade execution monitoring
- Event-driven order cache updates
- Enhanced transaction logging and audit trails
