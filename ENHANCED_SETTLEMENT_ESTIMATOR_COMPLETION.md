# Enhanced Settlement Estimator - Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the settlement estimator to use real settlement energy data and implement persistent power logging for more accurate calculations.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Power Logging System
- **Added persistent power arrays**: `powerLogArrays` Map to track power data over time per meter
- **Minute-by-minute logging**: New `@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)` job logs current power for all meters
- **Automatic cleanup**: Power logs are cleared after successful settlement
- **10-minute retention**: Only keeps last 10 minutes of power data for calculations

### 2. Settlement Energy Calculation
- **Real settlement energy**: Now uses `settlementEnergyWh.gridExport - settlementEnergyWh.gridImport` for `netEnergyWh`
- **Accurate current ETK**: `currentRunningEtk` calculated from actual accumulated settlement energy
- **Projected estimation**: `estimatedEtkAtSettlement` based on power rate and remaining settlement time

### 3. Average Power Calculation
- **Historical data**: Average power now calculated from logged power data array, not time series
- **More accurate**: Provides better representation of power trends over the settlement period
- **Persistent tracking**: Data persists across API calls until settlement reset

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added

```typescript
// Power logging utility methods
private addPowerLog(meterId: string, powerKw: number)
private getAveragePowerFromLog(meterId: string): number  
private clearPowerLog(meterId: string)

// Cron job for power logging
@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_MINUTE)
async logPowerData()
```

### Enhanced Settlement Estimator Logic

```typescript
// 1. Calculate actual net energy from settlement energy
const actualNetEnergyWh = 
  Number(settlementEnergyWh.gridExport) - Number(settlementEnergyWh.gridImport);

// 2. Get average power from logged data (not time series)
const averagePowerKw = this.getAveragePowerFromLog(meterId);

// 3. Calculate current running ETK from actual settlement energy
const currentRunningEtk = await this.blockchainService.calculateEtkAmount(
  Math.abs(actualNetEnergyWh),
);

// 4. Project additional energy based on power rate and remaining time
let estimatedAdditionalEnergyWh = 0;
if (averagePowerKw !== 0 && remainingHours > 0) {
  estimatedAdditionalEnergyWh = averagePowerKw * remainingHours * 1000;
}

// 5. Calculate estimated final settlement
const estimatedFinalNetEnergyWh = actualNetEnergyWh + estimatedAdditionalEnergyWh;
const estimatedEtkAtSettlement = await this.blockchainService.calculateEtkAmount(
  Math.abs(estimatedFinalNetEnergyWh),
);
```

## Data Flow

### Power Logging Flow
1. **Every minute**: Cron job runs `logPowerData()`
2. **For each meter**: Gets current real-time power data
3. **Logs power**: Adds `{ timestamp, powerKw }` to meter's power array
4. **Cleanup**: Removes entries older than 10 minutes
5. **Settlement reset**: Clears entire power array after successful settlement

### Settlement Estimation Flow
1. **Get settlement energy**: Extract `settlementEnergyWh` from latest real-time data
2. **Calculate actual net**: `gridExport - gridImport` = current accumulated energy
3. **Get average power**: From logged power data array (more accurate than time series)
4. **Project remaining**: Use power rate × remaining time to estimate additional energy
5. **Calculate ETK**: Convert both current and estimated energies to ETK amounts

## API Response Changes

### Before (old calculation):
```json
{
  "netEnergyWh": -197.3,           // Estimated from power × time
  "currentRunningEtk": 0.087,      // Proportional to time elapsed
  "estimatedEtkAtSettlement": 0,   // Based on estimated energy
  "averagePowerKw": -12.26         // From time series data
}
```

### After (enhanced calculation):
```json
{
  "netEnergyWh": -1430.0,          // From settlementEnergyWh (260.27 - 1690.27)
  "currentRunningEtk": 0.02,       // From actual settlement energy accumulation
  "estimatedEtkAtSettlement": 0.05, // Rate-based projection + remaining time
  "averagePowerKw": -12.26         // From logged power data array
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Accuracy**
- Uses actual settlement energy counters instead of power estimates
- Real-time tracking of accumulated energy since last settlement
- More precise ETK calculations based on actual energy flow

### 2. **Reliability** 
- Persistent power logging provides historical context
- Average power calculated from actual data points, not snapshots
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 3. **Predictive Capability**
- Rate-based estimation for remaining settlement period
- Better projection of final settlement amounts
- Helps users understand settlement progress

### 4. **Performance**
- Efficient in-memory power logging
- Leverages existing optimized real-time data queries
- Minimal database overhead

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SETTLEMENT_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Settlement period (default: 5)
- Power logging frequency: Fixed at 1 minute intervals
- Power retention: Fixed at 10 minutes

### Automatic Features
- Power logging starts automatically on service startup
- Arrays are automatically cleaned up after settlements
- Old power data is automatically purged

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Debug Logs
```typescript
this.logger.debug(
  `Settlement calculation for meter ${meterId}: ActualNet=${actualNetEnergyWh}Wh, Current=${currentPowerKw}kW, Average=${averagePowerKw}kW, EstimatedFinal=${estimatedFinalNetEnergyWh}Wh`,
);
```

### Power Log Tracking
- Each meter has its own power array
- Timestamps for each power reading
- Automatic cleanup of old entries

## Files Modified
1. `/src/services/energy-settlement.service.ts` - Enhanced estimator logic
2. `/test-enhanced-settlement-estimator.http` - Updated test file

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- Response structure unchanged (only calculation methods improved)
- No breaking changes to client applications

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced settlement estimator with real settlement energy data and persistent power logging implemented successfully.

The enhanced system now provides much more accurate settlement estimates by using actual energy accumulation data and historical power trends, giving users better visibility into their settlement progress and expected outcomes.
