### Expected enhanced response structure:
# {
#   "data": {
#     "meterId": "METER001",
#     "status": "IMPORTING",
#     "periodMinutes": 5,
#     "currentPowerKw": -19.4,
#     "averagePowerKw": -12.26,    // Now from logged power data, not time series
#     "estimatedEtkAtSettlement": 0.05,  // Based on rate of change and remaining time
#     "currentRunningEtk": 0.02,   // Based on actual settlementEnergyWh
#     "periodStartTime": "23:05",
#     "currentTime": "23:05",
#     "periodEndTime": "23:10",
#     "progressPercentage": 19.3,
#     "timeRemaining": "04:02",
#     "netEnergyWh": -1430.0,      // Now from settlementEnergyWh (gridExport - gridImport)
#     "settlementEnergyWh": {
#       "solar": "27844.9500",
#       "load": "25246.4100",
#       "battery": "24354.9800",
#       "gridExport": "260.2700",
#       "gridImport": "1690.2700"
#     }
#   }
# }

### Key Changes:
# 1. netEnergyWh = settlementEnergyWh.gridExport - settlementEnergyWh.gridImport
# 2. currentRunningEtk = actual ETK from accumulated settlement energy
# 3. estimatedEtkAtSettlement = projected based on power rate and remaining time
# 4. averagePowerKw = from logged power data array (updated every minute)
# 5. Power log arrays are reset after each settlement
